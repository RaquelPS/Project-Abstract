Vinho Verde wine Explorer

This Shiny App is for searching, visualizating and extracting useful information about the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine variety. The dataset used is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The total number of observations is 6497 and from those 6031 had the complete necessary information in order to develop the app (Note that the proportion of white wines is much higher that the red wines one).

In the first tab we can see a table containing the information chosen by the user, as well as a summary that helps us understand the units and ranges of each variable.

In the data visualization tab, we dispayed some plots representing the distribution of each variant of wine, in order for the user to have an idea of the taste and the quality proportions of the wines in general. Regarding the properties of these wines, we ploted a boxplot (which could be seen as a complement to the summary previously done), a bar plot showing the distribution of each property (differentiating between red and white variants), and a correlation plot that shows how usually the amount of each property makes another one's amount grow bigger/smaller or stay the same.

Last but not least, we implemented an predictive model that would give out the best variant of wine we should choose
